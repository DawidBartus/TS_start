extra:
"exclude": [] // if you don't want to exclude a file 

**/*.dev.ts - if we you don't want to compile a dev documents in the project

"node_modules" - add this to make compile faster - coz if the file in node_modules has a TS file it will compile it and we don't want it! => Its exclude by default

"include": ["index.ts"]

if you want to include a file, but if you set up the include you need to update the file that you want to include by hand

TS compile files: include - exclude => if you set file in both, the file won't be compile!

Lib - specifies which default object and function TS knows - e.g working with a DOM
if Lib isn't set, it takes info from JS version from target 

jsx - helps with react project!

"sourceMap": true, => helps with debugging 

outDir \ => where the created files should be saved
rootDir \=> specifies the root path 
removeComment => removes comments from root files 
noImplicitAny=> we have to be clear with our values - so declare a type 

[!]
Intersection Types
it helps us combine other types 

type guard => helps to verifies the type of value (e.g typeof)
